    "As students we have to worry about whether or not we can graduate with good grades and without too much debt. Dealing with these things with so many unknowns can make a student's life more difficult than it has to be. So we wanted to explore one of those unknowns. Many of us live off campus due to UCSD no longer offering 4 year guarunteed on-campus housing, and many of us rely on financial aid. So we wanted to explore the unknown relationships between\"off-campus housing\", rising tuition costs, and if financial aid is keeping up with both of them.\n",
