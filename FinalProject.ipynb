    "As students we have to worry about whether or not we can graduate with good grades and without too much debt. Dealing with these things with so many unknowns can make a student's life more difficult than it has to be. So we wanted to explore one of those unknowns. Many of us live off campus due to UCSD no longer offering 4 year guarunteed on-campus housing, and many of us rely on financial aid. So we wanted to explore the unknown relationships between\"off-campus housing\", rising tuition costs, and if financial aid is keeping up with both of them.\n",

This will allow us to analyze the financial impact on students in the UCSD area. \n",
