    "### Introduction and Background:\n",
    "As students we have to worry about whether or not we can graduate with good grades and without too much debt. Dealing with these things with so many unknowns can make a student's life more difficult than it has to be. So we wanted to explore one of those unknowns -- off campus housing. Many of us live off campus due to UCSD no longer offering 4 year guarunteed on-campus housing, and many of us rely on financial aid. So we wanted to explore the relationships between off-campus housing, rising tuition costs, and if financial aid is keeping up with both of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group would like to determine if housing prices and tuiton costs are rising, but fincancial aid is not adjusting accordingly then financial aid packages should be adjusted.\n"

    "From the Zillow API we are using the GetDeepSearchResults. This will allow us to get information such as rent price, when the home entered the market, location, region name, and much more. The specific fields our group is interested in are location, time the property entered the market, and rent per month. This will allow us to analyze the financial impact of housing relevant to students in the UCSD area. \n",
